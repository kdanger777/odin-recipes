# odin-recipes
Recipe website started with just HTML and then CSS added at a later time.
This current project is a website that will have recipes on it. To begin with I will be solely using HTML to build this site and will be returning to this project once I have learned CSS and will be using that new knowledge to add some style to the purely functional website that will exist at the start. The website will be basic and consist of multiple pages with the functionality to link between pages for easy navigation. The recipes used will be copied from other websites below and the content will not be my original work. This is solely for the purpose of developing my HTML and CSS skills.
